# Diabetic Retinopathy

Diabetic Retinopaty(DR) i.e. a serious condition  that occurs when the damaged blood vessels leak blood and other fluids into the retina, causing swelling and blurry.
The objective of our project is to find and implement the best method for computer-aided diagnostics of diabetic retinopathy to reduce the burden on ophthalmologists and mitigate diagnostic inconsistencies between manual readers.
To perform high bias , low variance digital image processing technique s for identifying one specific feature used in detection of subtle disease such as use of top-hat algorithm for microaneurysm detection.
To determine the sensitivity and specificity of our 4-ary classification model and evaluate performance by comparing results to currently published research data.
0 — No DR
1 — Mild
2 — Moderate
3 — Severe
4 — Proliferative DR
The above mentioned are the scale of of severity of diabetic retinopathy.
